                    <p>This brochure contains some common terms and definitions, which are intended to help you better understand your credit transaction. Credit costs money, so it is important that you fully understand the terms of your credit transaction. If you come across terms you do not understand, look up the terms, or ask our personnel to explain the terms to you. Ask questions. Make certain the questions that you ask are answered. Make certain you understand the terms and costs of your loan.</p>

The regulation prohibits creditor practices that discriminate on the basis of any of these factors.</p>
                    <p><strong>Contract</strong><br />A written binding document, describing terms of an agreement between two or more persons. (Keep all paperwork. Later, if there are any questions, you will have your agreement in writing.)</p>
                    <p><strong>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong><br />The cost of your credit as a yearly rate. This measures the cost of credit expressed as a yearly interest rate. It is intended to provide a single value for a consumer to compare the cost of credit between one lender and another.</p>
                    <p><strong>Finance Charge</strong><br />The dollar amount the credit will cost you. Finance charges include interest, and may also include transaction fees and service fees.</p>
                    <p><strong>Principal</strong><br />The amount of money owed on a debt, on which interest is calculated.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interest</strong><br />The cost of borrowing money, generally a percentage of the amount owed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Balance</strong><br />The total amount of money owed to a lender.</p>

                    <p><strong>Collateral</strong><br />Security pledged by a borrower to protect the interests of the lender; in case of default, the lender may take ownership of the security, if any, pledged by the borrower.</p>
                    <p><strong>Credit Bureau</strong><br />A private company that keeps a record of your credit history for distribution upon request by authorized parties. When you apply for credit, a lender may request a credit report to review when considering your application.</p>
                    <p><strong>Credit History</strong><br />A record containing information about you, including your payment history on previous debts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Credit Report</strong><br />A report of the credit history and other information about you that is kept by credit bureaus, which may include: your name, address, social security number, payment history (good and bad), current and previous debts, employers, income, etc. Accurate information on a credit report may not be legally removed.

                    <h4>What Are the Requirements for Approval?</h4>
                    <p>No documents are mandatory for approval, however the requirements for your loan may vary. Typically you will be requested to provide documentation regarding:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Checking or Savings account with Direct Deposit</li>
                        <li>Current job for at least 3 months</li>
                        <li>Valid state ID or driver's license</li>

                    <h4>Why Installment Loans May Be Better and More Flexible?</h4>
                    <p>You can make regular payments for a period of time, or you can payoff at any time without a penalty. Also, you are charged fees and interest only for the amount of time until you payoff your loan. Once you payoff, you will not pay any future installment payment.</p>

                        <li><strong>An advance of money obtained through a short term loan such as payday loan, auto title loan, installment loan or other credit services is not intended to meet long-term financial needs. A payday loan or auto title loan should only be used to meet immediate short-term cash needs. Refinancing the loan rather than paying the debt in full when due will require the payment of additional charges.</strong></li>
