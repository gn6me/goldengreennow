                    <p>This brochure contains some common terms and definitions, which are intended to help you better understand your credit transaction. Credit costs money, so it is important that you fully understand the terms of your credit transaction. If you come across terms you do not understand, look up the terms, or ask our personnel to explain the terms to you. Ask questions. Make certain the questions that you ask are answered. Make certain you understand the terms and costs of your loan.</p>
                    <p><strong>Common Terms and Definitions</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)</strong><br />A federal regulation which requires lenders to promote the availability of credit to all creditworthy applicants without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract); to whether all or part of the applicantâ€™s income derives from a public assistance program; or to whether the applicant has in good faith exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The regulation prohibits creditor practices that discriminate on the basis of any of these factors.</p>
                    <p><strong>Contract</strong><br />A written binding document, describing terms of an agreement between two or more persons. (Keep all paperwork. Later, if there are any questions, you will have your agreement in writing.)</p>
                    <p><strong>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</strong><br />The cost of your credit as a yearly rate. This measures the cost of credit expressed as a yearly interest rate. It is intended to provide a single value for a consumer to compare the cost of credit between one lender and another.</p>
                    <p><strong>Finance Charge</strong><br />The dollar amount the credit will cost you. Finance charges include interest, and may also include transaction fees and service fees.</p>
                    <p><strong>Principal</strong><br />The amount of money owed on a debt, on which interest is calculated.</p>
                    <p><strong>Interest</strong><br />The cost of borrowing money, generally a percentage of the amount owed.</p>
                    <p><strong>Balance</strong><br />The total amount of money owed to a lender.</p>
                    <p><strong>Default</strong><br />Failure to pay a debt as agreed to on a contract. When a loan is in default, the lender may demand full payment of the remaining debt.</p>
                    <p><strong>Collateral</strong><br />Security pledged by a borrower to protect the interests of the lender; in case of default, the lender may take ownership of the security, if any, pledged by the borrower.</p>
                    <p><strong>Credit Bureau</strong><br />A private company that keeps a record of your credit history for distribution upon request by authorized parties. When you apply for credit, a lender may request a credit report to review when considering your application.</p>
                    <p><strong>Credit History</strong><br />A record containing information about you, including your payment history on previous debts.</p>
                    <p><strong>Credit Report</strong><br />A report of the credit history and other information about you that is kept by credit bureaus, which may include: your name, address, social security number, payment history (good and bad), current and previous debts, employers, income, etc. Accurate information on a credit report may not be legally removed.

                    <h4>What Are the Requirements for Approval?</h4>
                    <p>No documents are mandatory for approval, however the requirements for your loan may vary. Typically you will be requested to provide documentation regarding:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Checking or Savings account with Direct Deposit</li>
                        <li>Current job for at least 3 months</li>
                        <li>Valid state ID or driver's license</li>

                    <h4>Why Installment Loans May Be Better and More Flexible?</h4>
                    <p>You can make regular payments for a period of time, or you can payoff at any time without a penalty. Also, you are charged fees and interest only for the amount of time until you payoff your loan. Once you payoff, you will not pay any future installment payment.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>An advance of money obtained through a short term loan such as payday loan, auto title loan, installment loan or other credit services is not intended to meet long-term financial needs. A payday loan or auto title loan should only be used to meet immediate short-term cash needs. Refinancing the loan rather than paying the debt in full when due will require the payment of additional charges.</strong></li>
                        <li>Loans obtained from the Companies affiliated with this website are for short term financial needs only and not intended as a long-term financial solution. A short term loan such as a payday loan, installment loan, line of credit, cash advance, credit plan agreement, or cash advance are short-term loans given to the borrower for a short period of time. Borrowers with debt and credit difficulties should seek out professional financial advice.</li>
                        <li>The Website does not constitute an offer or solicitation to offer a loan.</li>
                        <li>You are under no obligation to apply for credit or accept the terms of any loan and you will not be charged any fees unless you accept and sign a loan or credit plan on the terms set forth in the Agreement.</li>
                        <li>The rates and terms will vary by individual and by state for each loan or cash advance and may NOT be available in some states.</li>
                        <li>Due to state and verification requirements, not all applicants for online loans may be eligible for instant approval by the Companies affiliated with this website. You may be required to submit additional documentation.</li>
                        <li>We do not perform traditional credit checks as part of our credit transaction approval process, but do verify applicant information via national databases including, but not limited to, Tele-Track and CL Verify.

                        <li>The locations and Companies referred to on this Website may included several different Companies and entities, and not all locations and companies are affiliated with Golden Green Services, LLC.</li>
                        <li>Interest, post maturity interest, NSF fees, and late fees may result from non-payment. Your financial institution may also charge you additional fees for insufficient funds.</li>
                        <li>The Company complies with applicable collection laws. In some states, customers may obtain a payment plan. The Company will contact you using one or more authorized communication methods.</li>
                        <li>There may be fees associated with renewals or extension of your loan depending on your state and type of loan. Your loan will not renew automatically. If applicable in your state, a renewal depends on the Company's underwriting criteria.</li>
                        <li>Funds are available into your account generally the next business day after your application is approved (not pre-approved).</li>
                        <li>A 'pre-approval' does not mean that you will receive a loan. For final approval, you must meet certain criteria and verifications.</li>
