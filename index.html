                <p>Cash loans are cash advances designed to meet your emergency financial needs. Cash loans are also perfect for those times when you need a little extra cash for unexpected bills or special occasions. First, complete your loan application. Then your application will need to be approved. You will typically be contacted by a customer service representative to review your application. Once you are approved, you will receive funds into your account typically the next business day. After you receive your funds, you can log on, monitor and manage your account at any time.</p>

                    <h5>What Are the Requirements for Approval?</h5>
                    <p>No documents are mandatory for approval, however the requirements for your loan may vary. Typically you will be requested to provide documentation regarding:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Checking or Savings account with Direct Deposit</li>

                    <h5>What if I Have Poor Credit?</h5>
                    <p>No problem! Unlike many other financial institutions or credit unions, we do not require that you have good credit or, for that matter, any credit history at all. If you have any questions about qualifying, please contact us.</p>

                <div id="answer3" style="display:none;">

                <div id="answer6" style="display:none;">
                    <h5>Why Are Installment Loans Better and More Flexible?</h5>
                    <p>You can make regular payments for a period of time, or you can payoff at any time without a penalty. Also, you are charged fees and interest only for the amount of time until you payoff your loan. Once you payoff, you will not pay any future installment payment.</p>

                <div id="answer7" style="display:none;">
                    <h5>How Do I Recieve the Loan, and How Do I Repay the Loan?</h5>
                    <p>When you apply for a loan, you may authorize us to directly deposit the approved amount to your account. You may also authorize us to directly withdraw from your account your scheduled payments. You can make payments using a debit card, money order or other lender approved method.</p>
                </div>
                <div id="answer8" style="display:none;">

                <div id="answer9" style="display:none;">
                    <h5>In Which States Are You Authorized to Provide a Loan?</h5>
                    <p>Missouri, New Mexico, Texas, and Wisconsin. Although through a network of other lenders, you may be referred to another lender in another state if you are not a resident of any of the above.</p>

Borrowers with debt and credit difficulties should seek out professional financial advice.</li>

                                <li>We do not perform traditional credit checks as part of our credit transaction approval process, but do verify applicant information via national databases including, but not limited to, Tele-Track and CL Verify.
