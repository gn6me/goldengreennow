                            The following is intended to be an example of the fees and interested charged for

                        An advance of money obtained through a payday loan or auto title loan is not intended to meet long-term financial needs. 
                        A payday loan or auto title loan should only be used to meet immediate short-term cash needs. Refinancing the loan rather 
                        than paying the debt in full when due will require the payment of additional charges.
