            <p>
                No documents are mandatory for approval, however the requirements for your loan
                may vary. Typically you will be requested to provide documentation regarding:
                <ol>
                    <li>Checking or Savings account with Direct Deposit </li>
                    <li>Current job for at least 3 months </li>
                    <li>Valid state ID or driver’s license </li>
                    <li>Net income of $250 a week </li>
                </ol>

                <h2>
                    Why installment loans may be better and more flexible?</h2>
                <p>
                    You can make regular payments for a period of time, or you can payoff at any time
                    without a penalty. Also, you are charged fees and interest only for the amount of
                    time until you payoff your loan. Once you payoff, you will not pay any future installment
                    payment.</p>
                <br />
                <a name="Q4" id="Q4"></a>
                <h2>
                    What if you have poor credit?</h2>
                <p>
                    No problem! Unlike many other financial institutions or credit unions, we do not
                    require that you have good credit or, for that matter, any credit history at all.
                    If you have any questions about qualifying, please contact us.</p>

                    We can approve your loan application in a matter of minutes after you send us the
                    applicable documents, if required. We can deposit funds into your account, which
                    are normally available to you by the next business day, as long as you are approved
                    by 5pm CST.

                    about the status of your loan during normal business hours, Monday-Friday (10am-6pm
                    CST). For applications submitted after normal business hours, we will contact you
                    the next business day.

                    When you apply for a loan, you may authorize us to directly deposit the approved
                    amount to your account. You may also authorize us to directly withdraw from your
                    account your scheduled payments. You can make payments using a debit card, money
                    order or other lender approved method.</p>

                <p>
                    We follow the NACHA rules and regulations that regulate the electronic payment industry.
                    If you authorized electronic payments, the amount we withdraw from your account
                    will be the amount set forth on your payment schedule.</p>

                    What is an A.P.R.?</h2>
                <p>
                    Annual Percentage Rate or APR is defined as the cost of credit that customers pay,
                    expressed as an annual percentage. According to the federal Truth in Lending Act,
                    every consumer loan agreement must disclose the APR in large bold type. The annual
                    percentage rate is the finance charge the borrower actually pays, including loan
                    interest, points, and origination fees.</p>

                <p>
                    State law may regulate the maximum advance amount available to our customers. Although
                    there are other factors, you qualify for a particular cash advance amount based
                    on your current net income.</p>

                    You must contact us immediately! You will be responsible for any NSF fees and late
                    fees from debits that are returned. We encourage you to pay some money towards reducing
                    your principal balance. If you do pay extra towards your principal, you will reduce
                    the amount of interest and fees you would otherwise pay.</p>

                    Yes! You can payoff your loan at any time. We do not charge any pre-payment penalties.
                    You can contact us to let us know that you want us to debit your account earlier
                    than your due date. You may be entitled to a refund or discount of the fees, depending
                    on the date of your payment. If you do decide to payoff early, the amount of money
                    you pay in interest will be adjusted so you are only charged for the days your loan
                    is outstanding.</p>

                        An advance of money obtained through a payday loan or auto title loan is not intended to meet long-term financial needs. 
                        A payday loan or auto title loan should only be used to meet immediate short-term cash needs. Refinancing the loan rather 
                        than paying the debt in full when due will require the payment of additional charges.
