                        <h5>What Are the Requirements for Approval?</h5>
                        <p>No documents are mandatory for approval, however the requirements for your loan may vary. Typically you will be requested to provide documentation regarding:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Checking or Savings account with Direct Deposit</li>

                        <h5>Why Installment Loans May Be Better and More Flexible</h5>
                        <p>You can make regular payments for a period of time, or you can payoff at any time without a penalty. Also, you are charged fees and interest only for the amount of time until you payoff your loan. Once you payoff, you will not pay any future installment payment.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="answer3" style="display:none;">

                        <p>We can approve your loan application in a matter of minutes after you send us the applicable documents, if required. We can deposit funds into your account, which are normally available to you by the next business day, as long as you are approved by 5pm CST.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="answer5" style="display:none;">
                        <h5>What Documents Do You Require From Me?</h5>

                            <li>Generally, no documents are required; although requirements may vary</li>

                        <h5>When Will I Hear From You?</h5>
                        <p>You will be contacted by either email or phone, typically within 1 hour of applying, about the status of your loan during normal business hours, Monday-Friday (10am-6pm CST). For applications submitted after normal business hours, we will contact you the next business day.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="answer7" style="display:none;">
                        <h5>How Do I Recieve the Loan, and How Do I Repay the Loan?</h5>
                        <p>When you apply for a loan, you may authorize us to directly deposit the approved amount to your account.

                    <div id="answer8" style="display:none;">
                        <h5>What Amount of Money Will Be Withdrawn from My Account?</h5>
                        <p>We follow the NACHA rules and regulations that regulate the electronic payment industry. If you authorized electronic payments, the amount we withdraw from your account will be the amount set forth on your payment schedule.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="answer9" style="display:none;">
                        <h5>What is an A.P.R.?</h5>
                        <p>Annual Percentage Rate or APR is defined as the cost of credit that customers pay, expressed as an annual percentage. According to the federal Truth in Lending Act, every consumer loan agreement must disclose the APR in large bold type. The annual percentage rate is the finance charge the borrower actually pays, including loan interest, points, and origination fees.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="answer10" style="display:none;">
                        <h5>How is My Loan Amount Determined?</h5>
                        <p>State law may regulate the maximum advance amount available to our customers. Although there are other factors, you qualify for a particular cash advance amount based on your current net income.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="answer11" style="display:none;">

                    </div>
                    <div id="answer13" style="display:none;">
                        <h5>What Happens if I Don't Have Enough Funds to Pay a Scheduled Payment?</h5>
                        <p>You must contact us immediately! You will be responsible for any NSF fees and late fees from debits that are returned. We encourage you to pay some money towards reducing your principal balance. If you do pay extra towards your principal, you will reduce the amount of interest and fees you would otherwise pay.</p>

                        <p>Yes! You can payoff your loan at any time. We do not charge any pre-payment penalties. You can contact us to let us know that you want us to debit your account earlier than your due date. You may be entitled to a refund or discount of the fees, depending on the date of your payment. If you do decide to payoff early, the amount of money you pay in interest will be adjusted so you are only charged for the days your loan is outstanding.</p>
