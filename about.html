                            better understand your credit transaction. Credit costs money, so it is important that you
                            fully understand the terms of your credit transaction. If you come across terms you do not
                            understand, look up the terms, or ask our personnel to explain the terms to you. Ask
                            questions. Make certain the questions that you ask are answered. Make certain you

                        <p><b>Common Terms and Definitions</b></p>

                        <p><b>Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)</b><br />
                        A federal regulation which requires lenders to promote the availability of credit to all creditworthy applicants without regard to race,
                        color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, or age (provided the applicant has the capacity to contract); to whether all or part
                        of the applicantâ€™s income derives from a public assistance program; or to whether the applicant has in good faith exercised any right
                        under the Consumer Credit Protection Act. The regulation prohibits creditor practices that discriminate on the basis of any of these
                        factors.</p>

                        <p><b>Contract</b><br />
                        A written binding document, describing terms of an agreement between two or more persons. (Keep all paperwork. Later, if there
                        are any questions, you will have your agreement in writing.)</p>

                        <p><b>Annual Percentage Rate (APR)</b><br />
                        The cost of your credit as a yearly rate. This measures the cost of credit expressed as a yearly interest rate. It is intended to provide a
                        single value for a consumer to compare the cost of credit between one lender and another.</p>

                        <p><b>Finance Charge</b><br />
                        The dollar amount the credit will cost you. Finance charges include interest, and 
                        may also include transaction fees and service fees.</p>

                        <p><b>Principal</b><br />
                        The amount of money owed on a debt, on which interest is calculated.</p>

                        <p><b>Interest</b><br />
                        The cost of borrowing money, generally a percentage of the amount owed.</p>

                        <p><b>Balance</b><br />
                        The total amount of money owed to a lender.</p>

                        <p><b>Default</b><br />
                        Failure to pay a debt as agreed to on a contract. When a loan is in default, the lender may demand full payment of the remaining
                        debt.</p>

                        <p><b>Collateral</b><br />
                        Security pledged by a borrower to protect the<br />
                        interests of the lender; in case of default, the lender may take ownership of the security, 
                        if any, pledged by the borrower.</p>

                        <p><b>Credit Bureau</b><br />
                        A private company that keeps a record of your credit history for distribution upon request by authorized parties. When you apply for
                        credit, a lender may request a credit report to review when considering your application.</p>

                        <p><b>Credit History</b><br />
                        A record containing information about you, including your payment history on previous debts.</p>

                        <p><b>Credit Report</b><br />
                        A report of the credit history and other information about you that is kept by credit bureaus, which may include: your name,
                        address, social security number, payment history (good and bad), current and previous debts, employers, income, etc. Accurate
                        information on a credit report may not be legally removed. Incorrect information may be removed by disputing the information to

                        An advance of money obtained through a payday loan or auto title loan is not intended to meet long-term financial needs. 
                        A payday loan or auto title loan should only be used to meet immediate short-term cash needs. Refinancing the loan rather 
                        than paying the debt in full when due will require the payment of additional charges.
